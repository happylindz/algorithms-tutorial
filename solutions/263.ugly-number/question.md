Write a program to check whether a given number is an ugly number.

Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5. For example, 6, 8 are ugly while 14 is not ugly since it includes another prime factor 7.

Note:


	1 is typically treated as an ugly number.
	Input is within the 32-bit signed integer range.

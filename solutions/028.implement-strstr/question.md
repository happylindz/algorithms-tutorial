Implement strStr().

Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Example 1:


Input: haystack = &quot;hello&quot;, needle = &quot;ll&quot;
Output: 2


Example 2:


Input: haystack = &quot;aaaaa&quot;, needle = &quot;bba&quot;
Output: -1


Clarification:

What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C&#39;s&nbsp;strstr() and Java&#39;s&nbsp;indexOf().
